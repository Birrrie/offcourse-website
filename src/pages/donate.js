              <p>Today, professional education offers 6 year curricula, expensive courses, and one-size-fits-all courses. Many talents worldwide don't have the time or money to follow such programs. It is our aim to make learning accessible to people around the globe and put an end to <strong>talent waste</strong>.</p>
              <p>Our platform helps learners of all shapes and sizes to improve their learning. We provide a space where the web's best learning resources can be stored and shared.Â We encourage our community to explore, contribute, and share collections of hand-curated links.</p>
              <p>Offcourse is a not-for-profit organization. The learning platform we build is continuously under development. You can help us by making a donation to carry our mission forward.</p>
