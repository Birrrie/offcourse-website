How often did you think or say “I wish I knew how to _____”. It could be things you’ve seen on talent shows like singing and dancing. Or skills you’d like to master that require more learning, rather than a talent you are born with. Things like knowing how to build your own website or app, designing your own logo or how to make stunning photos.

Much of what you already know, or know how to do, you’ve picked up outside of any formal education. This might sound as a rather bold statement, but if you think about it, much of the knowledge you gained along the way of life you gained on your own. Things like politics, a country’s cultural characteristics, or easy bike repairments you’ve learned without taking any class. These are what we call self-taught skills. Do we ever think, however, what personal characteristics have helped us acquiring these skills?

Successful self-learning starts with a true motivation to learn a certain skill (like wanting to become a programming hero like Guido van Rossum, Bill Gates or Tim Berners-Lee). There are a few more characteristics to successful self-learners, or autodidacts, we’ll give you here. So, in case you’re about to learn something new on your own, think about these aspects before you start.


## Self-learners are focused and goal-oriented

It’s hard to start learning anything new without having defined what needs to be learned to acquire the desired skill. If you’re looking to learn how to build your own website or become a web developer, you’ll have to know you need to master the basics of HTMl to start with. This means you need to learn how to speak HTML semantics, create a HTML document, and how to set up a HTML structure. You might want to talk to a web developer to define your learning needs.

In addition, you need a goal for your learning. What makes you want to build your own website? Do you run a start-up and do you want to minimise costs in this early phase of your project? Or do you have the ambition to start a freelancing career as a web developer? Whatever it is, make it explicit so you’ll have an eagerness to master the skill. As you can imagine, self-learning requires dedication and having a clear goal in mind makes it easier to stick with your learning.


## Self-learners have an open mind

When you’re out there acquiring a new skill by learning everything you feel you need to know about the topic, you can easily become blind sighted. So, although you need to have a definition of what it takes to master that skill, you need to have an open mind to some extent. Especially when you feel confused or frustrated, which you will for sure for some moments in your learning process, you will have to find other ways to reach your goal.

Talking to other self-learners or people of whom you know to master the skill you are trying to acquire, can be of great help here. Be open to others point of view and decide for yourself what you can use to acquire the knowledge you need or choose how you can learn differently and better. Which is what brings us to the third and last characteristic of successful self-learners.


## Self-learners seek and give help to get better

Self-learning, although it does contain the word self, does not mean you cannot get help from other people in your learning process. In fact, even when you’re self-learning, you never completely learn entirely on your own. You need the help from books or articles, videos or any kind of web source. The knowledge and experience of other people can, as you’ve read above, be of great added value to your learning. The same goes for helping people that are looking to acquire the skill you already master, as it can help you learn more about the topic and potentially help you grow personally. This is the philosophy of Offcourse and it’s what we try to facilitate with our open source platform. The Offcourse platform facilitates a form of crowdsourced learning and is based on the principle “if everybody shares what they know in one place, everybody can learn what they want.”

As Offcourse, we ourselves also practice what we preach. Take our photographer, Christine. Here’s what she has to say about self-learning: *“ Ever since I was a little child, I taught myself new things. I was living in Austria and learned myself how to ski, basically through a lot of exploration.”* Christine had worked as an app developer for several years when she decided to teach herself the skills to become a photographer. *“ I started with Instagram photography, as there was no pressure to it there. After a while, I noticed that people would encourage me by giving positive feedback. It is why I started a community for people that love photography, to be able to share that love and knowledge. It really helps to talk to other photographers, also professional ones, to improve my skills and to help others. It is a great motivation.”*
