This post is written by Jan Hein Hoogstad. Thanks to 42workspace for sponsoring the meetup.

The theme of this monthâ€™s Serverless Meetup Rotterdam was MQTT. Thomas van der Veen took the lead in presenting a talk on this topic. The second speaker, Shannon Dealy, who planned to talk about Servers & Serverless, unfortunately had to cancel due to flu. As we had to compete with the Serverlessconf in Paris and high time for winter holidays, we had a slightly smaller group than at our previous meetups. No problem there, we held an unconference with the group on topics they liked to discuss: problem-solving in software development and the programming language Go.

Keep an eye on our Meetup page for upcoming dates and speakers, in which among others Shannon eventually will get a chance to present his talk too.
