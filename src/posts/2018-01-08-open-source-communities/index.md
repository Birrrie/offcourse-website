There are many views on how to create communities, especially open source communities. Open source communities have their own dynamics and are known to enable fast and innovative development.

The Offcourse platform, which will be launch this month, will facilitate such a community. A community of people that want to learn and improve their (programming) skills and that are willing to share their own knowledge with others. Some say a community of developers asks for a specific approach. That’s why one should give a lot of thought to how to create such an open community. Here are three aspects that are important, based on theory and practice.


## 1. A community culture

What makes people feel part of a community is its culture. Every community has a culture. It’s the way they live and behave, whether this involves an offline or online community. Within a community, you’ll find people that have common ground. It could be their background, ideas and interests, religion, language or something else.

What we have in common as the Offcourse community is that we share the same view on education and learning. With many technological capabilities, it is all at our fingertips to create alternative forms of learning. In education, technology is far from reaching its potential and changes in education are long overdue. We believe that the future of learning is one that we will create together. We call this crowd learning. Our belief is that if everybody shares what they know, everyone can learn what they want. This is a different approach to how our education system works. We see that formal education is not accessible to everyone. It’s also the reason why our founder, Jan Hein Hoogstad, started Offcourse. With a teaching background, he felt his ambitions no longer fitted the education system and started, as he calls it, his “band of misfits”; Offcourse.

From the above, you can say a community culture is very much about the values you share. For an open source platform like Offcourse, openness is one of the key values.


### Openness

The goal of Offcourse is to share knowledge so everyone can learn what they want. A community that is open and has open communication is thus a must. With openness we also mean to be open to a community that is highly diverse. For Offcourse, due to the diversity among the members of the community in experience (beginners/ medium level/ experienced developers) and background we add value to the learning content and process.


### Ownership

This is a very important value for an open source community. As the community itself handles the content on the platform, we as Offcourse ask our members to take ownership of their own content. This means we ask them to look after their own content and update or adjust it when needed.


### Involvement

Members of a community will have to feel connected to the other members to have open communication and to feel engaged to the community. For Offcourse this is of utmost importance because of the fact that learning can only be possible through the crowd. So we ask our members to be actively involved in sharing what they know so that everybody can learn what they want through the content on the platform.


## 2. Involvement of the members

What makes people want to be part of your community and actively contribute? Especially for an online community, it’s a challenge to have your members feel like a community when they don’t know who they’re working with.

*“ At Offcourse we offer meet-ups for our community members to get to know each other in person”*, Birgit explains. Birgit works as a business developer at Offcourse and is also responsible for the meet-ups for the community members. *“It’s inspiring to bring people together that have a shared interest and for them to see how much they have in common. The meet-ups we organize at Offcourse are furthermore a way to give our members extra learning possibilities. They are all organized around the specific topic of Serverless Infrastructures. The meet-ups very interesting, both for developers that are new to the topic, as well as more senior developers.”*

Engagement with your community, both digitally and personally, gives the opportunity to connect with the community on various levels. If you’re creating an open source community for learning or education like Offcourse, education is a great tool for engagement. Use workshops and events for this.


## 3. Empowerment by the platform owners

The power of an open source community is its diversity. It enriches the platform on which the community works together. Looking at Offcourse again, the team is a small group of enthusiasts. Together with a highly diverse community, yet, we can build something greater together. We all have our own expertise and an open source community, in essence, is self-organized. Activities such as support, in the event of a bug in the platform, are therefore executed by the community members themselves. It grows their involvement when they get empowered to solve problems together, each from their own perspective and expertise.

You can only empower the community when you provide them the tools to support collaboration and communication among the members. In addition to a central support center for the community to communicate with the platform owner(s), it makes sense for open source communities to make use of tools like Slack or GitHub for communication with other community members. The central support center, on the other hand, is something to be managed more closely as it provides platform owners insights for improvements to the platform.
