When we learn new skills, we all have our own preferences as to how we learn and for what reasons we want to learn these new skills. Some people still prefer to go to a physical classroom and hear a teacher speaking, but it might well be you take much more knowledge in by reading or watching videos. Also, the time you have available or are willing to spend on gaining these new skills really affects your preferred way of learning.

With all kinds of technological capabilities, it is all at our fingertips to create alternative forms of learning. If we look at the current way our global education system works, however, we don’t see many changes to the way education is given now and how it was given to our parents and even grandparents. Digital innovation still seems to be uncommon in this industry but is needed to cater to different needs and make learning more effective.

We are taking a look here at some examples of what is perceived as digital innovation in the education industry and give you our view on the latest developments.


## Lifelong learning
For most people, myself included, learning new skills is a lifelong endeavor and is therefore not limited to our time in college. Especially when you are part of the Generation Y like I am too, you have a lot of eagerness to learn, and this is only one of the life lessons of our generation. We all know we have to continuously develop our skills to remain interesting for a new employer, but also for our employers to keep us interested in our jobs by providing us training to learn new skills.

Going after the things that you want to learn about also gives a sense of direction and presents new opportunities for self-development. Isn’t that, in the end, what we all want- to become the best version of ourselves and be whoever we want to be? We do not limit ourselves to learning new skills only in college and we don’t want to be limited only by the option to go back to the classroom to get an education. Technology luckily has brought us some alternatives over the past decade or so.


## Education and technology
With the rise of technology, we have all gotten many possibilities to educate ourselves online on any topic. The great thing about teaching ourselves is that you feel a true motivation to learn. You can get a deep understanding of any topic of your choice, through the wide availability of e-books, articles and blogs, and Youtube tutorials. However, really big changes in our education system did not flow from this, despite the rise of technology and the disruption through technology in many other sectors, like warfare and healthcare for example.

We stick to an old-fashioned form of education in which students pay a fair amount of money still for any knowledge and are given only temporary access to that knowledge. This all is very much in contradiction with the world we live in, which is a world of living and learning online. Education hasn’t changed much, except for online-learning, but this is mostly just a translation of traditional education to a digital setting.

## The evolvement of online-learning as alternative education — MOOC’s and OER’s
One example of online-learning is the concept of Massive Online Open Courses, MOOC’s in short. Most often they are free courses provided by universities that are open for everyone to subscribe. The ambition of MOOC’s at the start was to make higher education accessible to everyone. Most famous are Coursera, Edx, and Udacity. All have their own form; Coursera has a rather commercial form that does not allow for the content of the courses to be re-used or shared, where Edx makes use of open licensing.

Ever since their start, MOOC’s have been moving away from providing free content, and are failing to make education accessible to everyone. This is unfortunate, especially because the real aim of creating MOOC’s was to bring a solution of worldwide accessibility at no cost.

Another example is the one of Open Educational Resources (OER’s) who provide open learning materials, available online, for reuse. They are similar to MOOC’s in form, but Academic Earth, for example, also provides scientific articles that are open to the public. In general OER’s serve more as research material for your studies, rather than actual courses. Still, they are provided by universities around the world, therefore have an educational background.

Both examples of MOOC’s and OER’s are rather traditional forms of education that have been simply translated into an online environment. You can’t really call this innovation and the wide possibilities of technology are not being used to really create an alternative way of learning.

## What will the future of learning hold?
As technology hasn’t been able to change the way we teach and learn, or we simply have not made great use of it yet, there are great opportunities for the future. What to think of making use of technologies like blockchain or chatbots in education. What we need is more experimentation with these different technologies in an educational environment.

So what should the future hold when it comes to learning? A world where everybody can learn anything online, in accordance with their own preferred way of learning should be the aim. This goes for both forms as well as content, e.g. learning by small bits and pieces instead of big courses.

Given that we live in a world where we can connect with anyone in the digital world and knowledge is potentially available to everyone and therefore can also be shared by anyone, it is the community itself that drives education in the future. The internet has the potential to be one big learning environment, not just for formal education.

Offcourse is a not for profit organisation building an open source platform where people can learn smarter together. We believe that the future of learning is a future that we will create together, a future of crowd sourced learning. Do you recognise yourself in our mission? Then we ask you to join.
