Learning analytics is the collection, measurement, analysis, and reporting of learning data with the intent to improve learning. They are used mostly in educational contexts where they matter to, for example, judge the functioning of learning materials by monitoring the way students learn.

There are more direct benefits to learning analytics for the learner himself too, rather then for the provider only. Examples are; simple statistics for easy navigation through the material, but also personalized recommendations for further learning. Here’s how they help different parties.


## Why learning analytics matter

Analytics is about extracting patterns, trends, and actionable information from large sets of data. For educational purposes, it helps getting answers to questions such as; What materials are your users interested in? How do they use your content materials? How do they interact with it? What are the wider trends in usage? As a teacher or educational institution, it gives you insights into areas for improvement.

We are all familiar with the good old offline tools to gather data from a group of people, such as surveys, interviews or focus groups. Although they are very useful methodologies to obtain qualitative feedback on your learning materials, there are quite a few quantitative tactics to give you insights in a split second.

Most Learning Management Systems (LMS) feature analytics that are built into the platform. They are systems, often web-based, used by online course providers to track and assess a learner’s work. Data will be gathered through the system to check a learner’s performance, the time it took the learner to complete, and the course completion rates. They are used to improve the e-learning itself, but the learner himself could also benefit more directly.


## How to use learning analytics for the direct benefit of the learner

Much of the analytics that are collected by educational institutions are used to improve learning materials. However, there is also an importance in helping students to learn better.

At Offcourse, our data analyst, Sander Reukema, is responsible for the implementation of learning analytics on the platform. He explains how he focuses on improving the learning abilities of the users. Sander: *“ We are a platform that facilitates learning. Through learning analytics, we, therefore, want to optimise learning for our community members. First of all, we need the actual data to be able to gather analytics. Because of the character of the platform where there is a continuous movement of the users that collect, tweak and share learning sources, there will be a great richness in data for us to use.”*


*“There are some relatively simple statistics that we will then use to improve the usability of the platform, like a time estimation to complete a task, the complexity of a text and the relevance of a learning source. Other than that we will make recommendations to our members to help them learn more and better, based on their activities and interests. This is a more commonly used tool, even outside the education industry. In addition, we want to stimulate them and keep them motivated by letting them create goals and targets for their own courses and make them earn points for doing so. Every member will have a personal dashboard in the future to track his or her own learning process that will support their learning.”*

A dashboard serves to track as well as to share individual learnings and is beneficial for three reasons;

* Users can track their own learning process in an easy, visual way.

* You can choose to make your personal dashboard public for others to see. Recruiters, for example, are also able to see your dashboard and contact you for positions that match your learning and experience.

* Companies can track the progress of their employees’ learning.

Learning analytics are an important step in making learning more personalised and giving learners the ability to learn on their own. Sander: *“I’m intrigued by using data to guide people in their learning process. I believe tracking and visualizing such data is an important step in motivating people to continuously learn new skills and to share their knowledge with others.”*
