                 <h1><u>PROBLEM DEFINITION</u></h1>
              <p>We live in a time where the 21st Century Skills are taking over the job market. The job market has never been so flexible, various and specific at the same time as it is now. Yet, there is lack of professionals that have specific tech, entrepreneurial or design skills to fill all these positions. How can we help people discover and develop their talent next to traditional job market skills? How can we help people to fill all these job offers at the market? What is the social impact of offering people an alternative way of learning the skills of this time?</p>
              <p>In a world that is ever growing, ever dynamic and ever changing, employment has become a concerning aspect in many peoples lives. Many even blame technology for the increase of unemployment, which could be true but is this generally the case?</p>
              <p>With our very first hackathon "Technology vs Life" we would like to contribute to decreasing the gap between the current job market and talent with 21st Century Skills from an individual, organisational and local perspective.</p>
                 <h1><u>WHAT IS OUR APPROACH?</u></h1>
              <p>See below the <strong>CHALLENGES</strong> we have created to contribute to gain more professionals in <strong>21st Century Skills</strong>. Fellow designers, analysts, coders and creatives, this is your chance to contribute by sharing your skills and putting your skills in practice at once!</p>
                 <h2><strong>LOCAL: TALENT MAPPING BY CREATING A PROFILE</strong></h2>
                 <h3>What is the social issue from a "local" perspective?</h3>
              <p>Employees are seeking the best jobs that fit their profile. Often these jobs are found through their personal network, companies they know and positions they find online. This results in talented individuals migrating from metropolitan/ urban areas. People now commute to further locations which becomes a great inconvenience for themselves and others. Consequences of this change include stress, fatigue and environmental pollution. How can we contribute into solving these issues?</p>
                 <h3>Here an idea for an innovative solution?!</h3>
              <p>Using Offcourse.io open-source code, create an integrated tool that supports a "job switch" between 2 individuals, from different locations but feature the same level and skill-set. Users would have to create a profile outlining their location, soft and hard skills which are then processed by the tool. As a result, the tool would "match" you with a similar job but closer to your home.</p>
                 <h3><strong>ORGANIZATIONAL: UPGRADE YOUR PROFILE BY DEVELOPING NEW SKILLS</strong></h3>
                 <h4>What is the social issue from an "organizational" perspective?</h4>
              <p>Skilled professionals leave their employers in search for opportunities that bring new challenges and help them grow. This is because workers are using their skills at a mediocre level and thus experience low levels of productivity due to instability, lack of motivation or boredom. The loss of skilled workers greatly impacts the skill-set and knowledge of companies as a whole. This loss affects their bottomline with training and recruitment processes.</p>
                 <h4>Here an idea for an innovative solution?!</h4>
              <p>Offcourse.io is an open-source and free knowledge sharing and transfer platform. By using the open source code of Offcourse.io, create an integrated tool, which based on the current skills of the employee allows the tool to give suggestions what to learn next in order to upgrade their profile. Hence, makes suggestions for self-improvement and positions that open up after upgrading their profile.</p>
                 <h3><strong>INDIVIDUAL: GET REWARDED BASED ON THE NEW DEVELOPED SKILLS</strong></h3>
                 <h4>What is the social issue from an "individual" perspective?</h4>
              <p>You have skills and/or talent that you would like to develop and put into practice. However, the traditional curricula does not support your learning style, material is inaccessible and the process of learning is long before you can reap the rewards.</p>
                 <h4>Here an idea for an innovative solution?!</h4>
              <p>Offcourse.io is a mediator tool between open-knowledge available on the internet and end users (you). Through Offcourse.io open-source code create a tool that outlines a reliable reward system for its users. This will function on the different levels a user has obtained for completing the curricula. This is not a controlled feature, but rather a tool which will help measure and determine one's level in a given sector/topic/expertise.</p>
