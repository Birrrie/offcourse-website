This is different from UDP, as UDP is connectionless. MQTT was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport from machine to machine. There is no message format for MQTT, you can send any type of message over MQTT. It is therefore designed for many different use cases.</p>\n<p>Examples of use cases include push instead of pull messaging and enterprise to mobile messaging. A concrete example of an enterprise to mobile use case is Facebook Messenger. Thomas also gave an example of Siberia where the Internet connection is established over satellites. This is a nice example of Internet-Of-Things.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"March 09, 2018",path:"/blog/think-twice",title:"Think twice",featuredImage:{childImageSharp:{resolutions:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",width:900,height:300,src:"/offcourse-website/static/meetup-687bf10b679e8856fb32830f415f931f-f5803.jpg",srcSet:"/offcourse-website/static/meetup-687bf10b679e8856fb32830f415f931f-f5803.jpg 1x"}}}}}},pathContext:{}}}});
