Thanks to 42workspace for sponsoring the meetup.</p>\n<p>The theme of this monthâ€™s Serverless Meetup Rotterdam was MQTT. Thomas van der Veen took the lead in presenting a talk on this topic. The second speaker, Shannon Dealy, who planned to talk about Servers &#x26; Serverless, unfortunately had to cancel due to flu. As we had to compete with the Serverlessconf in Paris and high time for winter holidays, we had a slightly smaller group than at our previous meetups. No problem there, we held an unconference with the group on topics they liked to discuss: problem-solving in software development and the programming language Go.</p>\n<p>Keep an eye on our Meetup page for upcoming dates and speakers, in which among others Shannon eventually will get a chance to present his talk too.</p>",frontmatter:{date:"March 10, 2018",path:"/blog/charm",title:"Three strikes",featuredImage:{childImageSharp:{resolutions:{base64:"data:image/jpeg;base64,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",width:900,height:300,src:"/static/graphql-cb65aa77f04c98250d91cfd0460351f2-f5803.jpg",srcSet:"/static/graphql-cb65aa77f04c98250d91cfd0460351f2-f5803.jpg 1x"}}}}}},pathContext:{}}}});
